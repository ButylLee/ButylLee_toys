* [VarTypeDict](VarTypeDict): A Dictionary that can contain various type value, using C++ template meta-programming.
* [DynArray](DynArray): A multi-dimension Dynamic Array that acts like VLA in C, but alloc in heap, using proxy class and template meta-programming, has the performance approaching to the built-in stack array.
* [EncryptedString](EncryptedString): A convenient way to create encrypted string in source code, which makes string literals invisible in binary after compiling and decrypt it in run-time. But the implementation has some limitations without using macro and the resultant behavior is strongly depend on the compiler.
